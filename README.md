## Installation

Download and extract the [zip archive](https://github.com/mbrughi/dgwm/archive/master.zip) to a `dgwm` folder in your WordPress installation `wp-content/plugins`.

Alternatively, as a single-file plugin, it can be downloaded directly and placed within the [`mu-plugins` directory](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) of a site.

```
mkdir -p wp-content/mu-plugins && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrughi/dgwm/master/index.php > wp-content/mu-plugins/dgwm.php
```

## Usage

Tooltips are disabled as long the plugin is activated.
